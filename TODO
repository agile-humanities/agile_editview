Important new features:

* Add support for users/profiles (#603648, #235385)
* Add support for locations (issue ???)
* Make it possible to mark fields as editable (#635076)
  And make the add a new node form independent of this (#527558)
  This will also solve fields which are not displayed at all now (#481956, 
  #472986)
  And probably the image problem (#248337, #242477, #219344)
* Create a Save All button (#151278)
  Or perhaps optionally a commit-when-leaving-a-field option so we do not
  need a save button at all (#583526)
* Surpress headings on each row (#583542)
  Related: help text (#885712)
* Mark changed fields (#583540, #151274)
* Do something about field input types, for Wysiwyg, input formats, etc. 
  (#467028) and for number of lines in the text box (#500042)
* Access control (front page): only show content if a user may not edit
* Show fields as required (front page)
* Use content types field labels when views labels are left blank (front page)


Secondary new features:

* Add support for Ubercart (#342172, #863274)
* Add support for Casetracker (#737378)
* Add support for views_customfield (#527822)
* Add support for path_auto (#244748)
* Add support for Draggable Views (#466032)
* Investigate other lay-out options (#581488, #484762, #375710)
* Add "Node edit"/"Node delete" buttons optionally (#459596)
* Add several new nodes at once (#586130)
  Not entirely clear what the request is. May be useful with the Save All
  button. At the moment, it seems that the commit on a new node does a
  full page refresh? See #586142 for a request to Ajaxify this
* Disable Ajax updates optionally (#561442)
  Not sure if this is a good idea - Drupal everywhere uses Ajax if it 
  is available and nowhere allows it to be selectively turned off AFAIK
* Add support for Organic Groups (#586160)
* Do not display empty rows (#560084)
* Multiple node types (#559754)
  Probably impossible to implement cleanly, but should be investigated
* Add support for node settings like "comments allowed" (#885720)
* Optionally disable JS animations (#467056)
* Add support for file field or other uploads (#121407)
* Add support for ASIN (#121154)
* Add support for Link (#121154)
* Investigate if it would be possible to leave out the unused fields instead
  of hiding them (this would involve reassembling the form on submit)
  (See #236853 comment #3).


Important bugs:

* Check error messages with ERR_ALL (#850714)
  I can not reproduce this, may be related to a specific field type.
* Check memory consumption (#640684, #477288, #719806, front page)
  May be related to using a Javascript text box editor
  May sometimes be SQL timeouts due to cache (#401186)
* views_embed_view gives errors (#660200)
* Random failures (#767206, #655290, #201783, #477292)
* Javascript problems (#222302, #217944)
* Fix outstanding taxonomy problems, especially free tagging (#460206, #172797,
  #347568, #172797, #655942, #219344)
  Last one is actually a feature request...
* Lay-out or CSS problems (#308876)


Secondary bugs:

* Check bad interaction with editable fields (#599140)
* Check bad interaction with Signup module (#804642, #714002)
* Check bad interaction with Taxonomy Access module (#885704)
* Theming problems (#459642)

Drupal 5 only:
* Possible issues with the date module (#310517)
* Problems with checkboxes (#284359)
* Lay-out or CSS problems (#125401)
